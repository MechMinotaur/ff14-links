Here's a dump of all the links I use frequently for FF14.

# Information

## [Console Games Wiki](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/FF14_Wiki)
I always have this page open while playing. Tons of good information.

## [Heavenswhere](http://heavenswhere.com/)
Detailed maps of points of interest. Very useful doing aether currents which unlock flying in Heavensward and beyond. Also handy for hunts and treasure maps.

## [Eorzea Collection](https://ffxiv.eorzeacollection.com/)
Website dedicated to cool glamour sets. Can help with glamour ideas and the level of detailed filtering you can do to find the perfect outfit is pretty nuts.

## [Icy Veins Job Guides](https://www.icy-veins.com/ffxiv/final-fantasy-xiv-job-guides)
Very useful for in-depth explanation of how each of the jobs work, what their abilities do, when you should be using what ability, and what gear to look out for.

## [Official FF14 Job Guides](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/jobguide/battle)
Not as in-depth as the Icy Veins guides will be, but great when you first pick up a job. It's simply a list of all the abilities the job can do and where to unlock it.

## [FF14 Lodestone](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/)
Patch notes, character profiles, dev blogs, server status, upcoming maintenance, and more. Basically the central "official" hub for FF14.

# Tools

## [Mini-Cactpot](https://super-aardvark.github.io/yuryu/)
Once a day you can play mini-cactpot for MGP once you unlock the gold saucer. This tool will give you the best chance at consistently winning the most MGP.

## [Universalis Market Board](https://universalis.app/)
Check the price of something while you aren't next to the market board. Be careful using this as items that don't get frequently traded can sometimes be out of date by quite a bit.

## [Chocobo Color Guide](https://ffxivchocobo.com/en)
Eventually you will be able to dye your chocobo whatever color you want. This tool helps tell you how many and what order of each food item you'll need to feed your chocobo to achieve your desired color.

## [Etro Gear sets](https://etro.gg/gearset)
Useful in end game when trying to determine what gear and materia you should prioritize. You can even share your gear sets with other players.

# Discords
## [Centurio Hunts](https://discord.gg/centuriohunts)
Sign up for a FATE or hunt you need to down and you'll get notified when it's up. Since a bunch of the community uses this server, there will be plenty of people there too!

## [The Balance](https://discord.gg/thebalanceffxiv)
Similar to the aforementioned Icy Veins Job Guides but in discord format.

## [Blue Academy](https://discord.gg/blueacademy)
Very helpful information on the Blue Mage class. The "Headmaster" Liam Galt also has a fantastic [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BlueAcademy) where he uploads how to do tons of Blue Mage related activities.

## [Setting up ACT Damage Meters](https://youtu.be/urZTrF864x8)
**WARNING** Never tell anyone in game you are using a damage meter, you will be banned! **WARNING**

Displays how much damage you and your party members are dealing. Essential tool at getting better at the game.

## [FFLogs](https://www.fflogs.com/)
Upload your damage logs and view others. Not the easiest site to navigate, but great for viewing data if you can figure out how to ask it. Upload your own with their [uploader application](https://www.fflogs.com/client/download)

## [G-Shade](https://gposers.com/gshade/)
Custom shaders for Final Fantasy 14 and some other games. Makes the game a bit more vibrant. Depending on which shader you choose though it could drag down your FPS so use with care!

## [Maygi's POTD 1-200 Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQpzFuhmSwTXuZSmtnKLNgQ0nRhumCFaB8NvCXFXSjrBHPRT5lXY8jMR4RaCK1aNfcl_G5ph5DNNwfl/pub#id.y1uv222l53b5)
Highly informative and in-depth google doc for completing Palace of the Dead. I refer to this constantly on solo attempts.
