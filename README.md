Here's a dump of all the links I use frequently for FF14.

# Information

## [Console Games Wiki](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/FF14_Wiki)
I always have this page open while playing. Tons of good information.

## [Heavenswhere](http://heavenswhere.com/)
Maps with points of interest. Very useful for:

## [Eorzea Collection](https://ffxiv.eorzeacollection.com/)
Website dedicated to cool glamour sets. Can help with glamour ideas. Has a nice level of detailed filtering to help find the perfect outfit.

## [Icy Veins Job Guides](https://www.icy-veins.com/ffxiv/final-fantasy-xiv-job-guides)
Guides offering in-depth explanation of how each of the jobs work, what their skills do, when you should be using those skills, and what gear they should use.

## [Official FF14 Job Guides](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/jobguide/battle)
Not as in-depth as the Icy Veins guides will be, but great when you first pick up a job. It is mostly a list of all the skills the job can do and where to unlock it.

## [Official FF14 Lodestone](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/)
Official hub for Final Fantasy 14. Contains patch notes, character profiles, dev blogs, server status, upcoming maintenance, and more.

## [Official FF14 Play Guide - Housing](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/contentsguide/housing_land/)
Housing chapter of the official Final Fantasy 14 play guide. Contains helpful information including plot restrictions, limitations, pricing, and information on how to buy a house.

## [PaissaDB](https://zhu.codes/paissa)
Database of available housing plots in each world. Scrapes data using a [plugin](https://github.com/zhudotexe/FFXIV_PaissaHouse#lottery-sweeps) if you'd like to contribute.

# Tools

## [Mini-Cactpot](https://super-aardvark.github.io/yuryu/)
Once a day mini-cactpot can be played for MGP after unlocking the [Gold Saucer](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Gold_Saucer). This tool will provides the best chance at consistently winning the most MGP.

## [Universalis Market Board](https://universalis.app/)
Useful for checking the price of something while away from a market board. Be careful using this as items that don't get frequently traded can sometimes be out of date by quite a bit.

## [TeamCraft's Currency Spender](https://ffxivteamcraft.com/currency-spending)
Useful for figuring out what to spend the various currencies on if you simply want the most gil. Less useful than it used to be, as many of these items seem to keep getting out of sync lately with what current market board prices actually are.

## [FF14 Advanced Market Board Search](https://www.ff14advancedmarketsearch.com/)
Collection of various tools to play the market.

## [Chocobo Color Guide](https://ffxivchocobo.com/en)
This tool helps with coloring chocobo by showing how many and in what order of each food item is required to achieve the desired color.

## [Etro Gear sets](https://etro.gg/gearset)
Useful for trying to determine what gear and materia you should prioritize. Gear sets can even be shared with other players. More useful near the end of the game than the start.

## [Garland Tools](https://garlandtools.org/)
Useful for looking up a particular item and viewing it in 3D. Also has various timers and fishing tools.

# Discords
## [Centurio Hunts](https://discord.gg/centuriohunts)
Sign up for a FATE or hunt you need to down and you'll get notified when it's up. Since a bunch of the community uses this server, there will be plenty of people there too!

## [The Balance](https://discord.gg/thebalanceffxiv)
Similar to the aforementioned Icy Veins Job Guides but in discord format.

## [Blue Academy](https://discord.gg/blueacademy)

# Disciple of Hand and Land

Crafting rotations and simulations as well as the tools to create your own.

## [Ishgardian Restoration and relic guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vgtU7HFtG87TrJ9U47vnzkFMhSl5HKz7bjJhRXbxaas/edit#)
Information on Firmament and Diadem. I mostly used this doc for macros when levelling up a DOH in the Firmament.

# Other

## In-game settings, tips, and tricks
Below is a list of general tips and tricks that I found useful. Use at your discretion as you won't find all of them cater to you.

## [DPS Meter/Parser & MopiMopi](https://youtu.be/urZTrF864x8)
⚠ Never mention in game you are using a damage meter, you will be banned! ⚠

Walk-through for setting up Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT) and the MopiMopi overlay. Displays how much damage you and your party members are dealing. Essential tool for getting better at the game.

## [FFLogs](https://www.fflogs.com/)
Upload and view damage logs captured by ACT. Upload your own with their [uploader application](https://www.fflogs.com/client/download).

## [ReShade](https://reshade.me/)
Custom shaders for video games. While there exists a variety of games and shaders that can be used with ReShade, for Final Fantasy 14 specifically, I suggest Ipsusu's shaders and guide which can be found [here](https://github.com/ipsusu/IpsuShade#brief-reshade-install-guide-for-ffxiv).

## [Maygi's Deep Dungeon Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wc0LHgUZmmqMUnRflZsDxc3JtHS0dxO9D4WH--UQk_E/preview#)
Highly informative and in-depth google doc for completing Palace of the Dead, Heaven on High, and Eureka Orthos.

## [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher/releases/tag/6.3.1)
⚠ Never mention in game you are using plugins or a custom launcher, you will be banned! ⚠

Custom launcher for Final Fantasy XIV. In addition to launching the game, it also launches the  [Dalamud Plugin Framework](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) which enables custom plugins that support a wide variety of quality of life improvements to the game. It's also possible to have the launcher start ACT automatically when the game starts. The launcher also allows saving XIV credentials so a username and password don't have to be entered on every login.

## [Wyn's Relic Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I2ahF7oFw6WN1nz-f8gzuqJvq1kG2K3MMq-O4U759dw/edit#gid=831614995)
Great for tracking progress on relic weapons across all expansions.
