# Job and Class Specific Information

## [Icy Veins Job Guides](https://www.icy-veins.com/ffxiv/final-fantasy-xiv-job-guides)
Guides offering in-depth explanation of how each of the jobs work, what their skills do, when you should be using those skills, and what gear they should use.

## [Official FF14 Job Guides](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/jobguide/battle)
Not as in-depth as the Icy Veins guides will be, but great when you first pick up a job. It is mostly a list of all the skills the job can do and where to unlock it.

## [Wesk Alber's Leveling Guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJQKqKWn8Zg&list=PLoXER4idrFLb3lsk2Y6g0VmVrWqmIovFT&pp=iAQB)
Helpful guides for leveling up a job. Whereas the Official and Icy Veins job guides are great for playing a job at max level, these guides aim to provide information for the levels in between.

# [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher/releases/tag/6.3.1)
⚠ Never mention in game you are using plugins or a custom launcher, you will be banned! ⚠

Custom launcher for Final Fantasy XIV. In addition to launching the game, it also launches the  [Dalamud Plugin Framework](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) which enables custom plugins that support a wide variety of quality of life improvements to the game. It's also possible to have the launcher start ACT automatically when the game starts. The launcher also allows saving XIV credentials so a username and password don't have to be entered on every login. This is also the best way to play the game on an unsupported operating system like Linux.

# Tools

## DPS Meter and Parsing
⚠ Never mention in game you are using a damage meter, you will be banned! ⚠

Damager per second is measured in this game using either a standalone tool called [ACT](https://youtu.be/urZTrF864x8) or the XIVLauncher plugin [IINACT](https://www.iinact.com/installation/). Both tools work fine so pick whichever one works for you.

ACT has the 14 overlay kind of baked in and also does not require the XIVLauncher be installed, unlike IINACT. This overlay can be floated to another monitor.

IINACT purely uses websocket which can be viewed from a web browser or by downloading another XIVLauncher plugin like Browsingway from the in game addons menu. Sine IINACT is working purely off the Dalamud plugin engine running in the XIVLauncher and displaying data to a websocket viewable by any sort of browser, it is also vastly easier to get setup and running on Linux.

## [FFLogs](https://www.fflogs.com/)
View battle logs. Upload your own with their [uploader application](https://www.fflogs.com/client/download).

## [ReShade](https://reshade.me/)
Custom shaders for video games. While there exists a variety of games and shaders that can be used with ReShade, for Final Fantasy 14 specifically, I suggest Ipsusu's shaders and guide which can be found [here](https://github.com/ipsusu/IpsuShade#brief-reshade-install-guide-for-ffxiv).

## [TeamCraft](https://ffxivteamcraft.com)
Crafting rotations and simulations as well as the tools to create your own.

## [Mini-Cactpot](https://super-aardvark.github.io/yuryu/)
Once a day mini-cactpot can be played for MGP after unlocking the [Gold Saucer](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Gold_Saucer). This tool will provides the best chance at consistently winning the most MGP.

## [Universalis Market Board](https://universalis.app/)
Useful for checking the price of something while away from a market board. Be careful using this as items that don't get frequently traded can sometimes be out of date by quite a bit.

## [TeamCraft's Currency Spender](https://ffxivteamcraft.com/currency-spending)
Useful for figuring out what to spend the various currencies on if you simply want the most gil. Less useful than it used to be, as many of these items seem to keep getting out of sync lately with what current market board prices actually are.

## [FF14 Advanced Market Board Search](https://www.ff14advancedmarketsearch.com/)
Collection of various tools to play the market.

## [Chocobo Color Guide](https://ffxivchocobo.com/en)
This tool helps with coloring chocobo by showing how many and in what order of each food item is required to achieve the desired color.

## [Etro Gear sets](https://etro.gg/gearset)
Useful for trying to determine what gear and materia you should prioritize. Gear sets can even be shared with other players. More useful near the end of the game than the start.

## [Garland Tools](https://garlandtools.org/)
Useful for looking up a particular item and viewing it in 3D. Also has various timers and fishing tools.

## [Wyn's Relic Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11N-u7o2-0cbL4E61rfpXHgAPK2X8S_lwyFUigKAQb08/edit#gid=831614995)
Great for tracking progress on relic weapons across all expansions.

# Discords
## [Centurio Hunts](https://discord.gg/centuriohunts)

## [The Balance](https://discord.gg/thebalanceffxiv)
Similar to the aforementioned Icy Veins Job Guides but in discord format.

## [Blue Academy](https://discord.gg/blueacademy)
Very helpful information on the Blue Mage class. The "Headmaster" Liam Galt also has a fantastic [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BlueAcademy) where he uploads how to do tons of Blue Mage related activities.

## [The Help Lines](https://discord.com/invite/Nnkq9UW)
Hosts events for a variety of group content, [Baldesion Arsenal](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Baldesion_Arsenal) in particular.

## [Lego Steppers](https://discord.com/invite/YKP76AsMw8)
