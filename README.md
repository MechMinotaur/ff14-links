Here's a dump of all the links I use frequently for FF14.

# Information

I always have this page open while playing. Tons of good information.

Guides offering in-depth explanation of how each of the jobs work, what their skills do, when you should be using those skills, and what gear they should use.

## [Official FF14 Job Guides](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/jobguide/battle)
Not as in-depth as the Icy Veins guides will be, but great when you first pick up a job. It is mostly a list of all the skills the job can do and where to unlock it.

Once a day mini-cactpot can be played for MGP after unlocking the [Gold Saucer](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Gold_Saucer). This tool will provides the best chance at consistently winning the most MGP.

## [Universalis Market Board](https://universalis.app/)
Useful for checking the price of something while away from a market board. Be careful using this as items that don't get frequently traded can sometimes be out of date by quite a bit.

## [TeamCraft's Currency Spender](https://ffxivteamcraft.com/currency-spending)
Useful for figuring out what to spend the various currencies on if you simply want the most gil. Less useful than it used to be, as many of these items seem to keep getting out of sync lately with what current market board prices actually are.

## [FF14 Advanced Market Board Search](https://www.ff14advancedmarketsearch.com/)
Collection of various tools to play the market.

## [Chocobo Color Guide](https://ffxivchocobo.com/en)
This tool helps with coloring chocobo by showing how many and in what order of each food item is required to achieve the desired color.

## [Etro Gear sets](https://etro.gg/gearset)
Useful for trying to determine what gear and materia you should prioritize. Gear sets can even be shared with other players. More useful near the end of the game than the start.

## [Garland Tools](https://garlandtools.org/)
Useful for looking up a particular item and viewing it in 3D. Also has various timers and fishing tools.

# Discords

Similar to the aforementioned Icy Veins Job Guides but in discord format.

## [Blue Academy](https://discord.gg/blueacademy)

⚠ Never mention in game you are using a damage meter, you will be banned! ⚠

Walk-through for setting up Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT) and the MopiMopi overlay. Displays how much damage you and your party members are dealing. Essential tool for getting better at the game.

Upload and view damage logs captured by ACT. Upload your own with their [uploader application](https://www.fflogs.com/client/download).

## [G-Shade](https://gposers.com/gshade/)
Custom shaders for Final Fantasy 14. Makes the game a bit more vibrant. Exercise caution when picking a shader as some drag CPU/GPU performance down! Seems to be compatible with other games too.

## [Maygi's POTD 1-200 Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQpzFuhmSwTXuZSmtnKLNgQ0nRhumCFaB8NvCXFXSjrBHPRT5lXY8jMR4RaCK1aNfcl_G5ph5DNNwfl/pub#id.y1uv222l53b5)
Highly informative and in-depth google doc for completing Palace of the Dead. I refer to this constantly on solo attempts.


## [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher/releases/tag/6.3.1)
⚠ Never mention in game you are using plugins or a custom launcher, you will be banned! ⚠

Custom launcher for Final Fantasy XIV. In addition to launching the game, it also launches the  [Dalamud Plugin Framework](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) which enables custom plugins that support a wide variety of quality of life improvements to the game. It's also possible to have the launcher start ACT automatically when the game starts. The launcher also allows saving XIV credentials so a username and password don't have to be entered on every login.
